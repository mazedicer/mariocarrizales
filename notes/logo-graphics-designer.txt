Hi,

My name is Mario Carrizales.
I have 5+ years of professional logo design experience.
You can find my resume online: http://mariocarrizales.com
Artwork: http://mcbrgart.com

Quoting Process:
Depends on the detail and complexity of the design.
Preferably, clients send/post a detailed description of their logo design.
Based on that and from personal experience I work out a price and the fair number of revisions with the client.
I will draw 3 color sketches for you to look at.
Then, you tell me if you want to continue.
If you do:
$80 - pick a design you like and I will create the logo (vectorized)
$15 - revisions: will be applied to the design you choose if any changes to the original sketch.
In other words, it's easier to draw another color sketch than start vector work, then try to change that initial vector work.
