/***********************************************************************
SCRUM
***********************************************************************/
Iterative and incremental agile software development framework for managing product development.
1. Handles unpredicted challenges.
2. Focuses on maximizing the teams ability to deliver quickly, respond to emerging requirements and
to adapt to evolving technologies and changes in market conditions.
/***********************************************************************
SCRUM ROLES
***********************************************************************/
ScrumMaster, Product Owner, Delivery Team
//Product Owner
One person not a committee.
The entire organization must respect the product owner desicions.
Nobody does more or less than what is specified on the product backlog.
1. Maximize the value of the product, work of the team.
2. Manage product backlog:
	a. express backlog items clearly
	b. ordering backlog items to best achieve goals
	c. optimize the value of the work the team performs
	d. makes sure everybody understands the product backlog
//ScrumMaster
The mediator between the Product Owner and the Delivery team.
Removes any impediments obstructing the team from achieving its sprint goals.
Advices the Product owner about how to maximize ROI for the team.
1. Help the team determine the definition of done for the product
2. Coaches the team, within scrum principles.
3. Promotes self organization.
4. Educate key stakeholders in the product on scrum principles.
//Delivery team
About 7 members (officially 3-9), ideally in one team room protected from outside distractions.
A typical team includes a mix of software engineers,architects,programmers,analysts,QA experts,testers, and UI designers.
Each sprint, the team is responsible for determining how it will accomplish the work to be completed.

SCRUM EVENTS
***********************************************************************/
Release planning(Product Backlog)>Sprint planning(Sprint Backlog)>Daily Scrum>1-4 Weeks>Sprint Review>
Sprint Retrospective(Potential shippable product increment)>Repeat--->Release planning...
//The Sprint
It s a working product increment.
Usually a duration of two weeks or one month, and this duration remains constant for all sprints.
Cannot have varying durations for the different sprints in a project.
A Sprint goal is set as the objective and used as a guide for the team.
A Sprint should be cancelled if it becomes obsolete based on market or technology changes and conditions.
//Sprint planning
The work to be performed in the Sprint is planned in the Sprint Planning meeting.
4hrs for 2week sprints, 8hrs for 1month sprints.
Focuses on the following two questions:
	1. What needs to be and can be delvered in the Sprint Increment?
	2. How will the work needed for the execution of Sprint be achieved?
The input to this meeting are:
	Product backlog
	Latest product increment
	Projected capacity of the team
	Past performance of the team
The team decides on what functionality can be developed during the Sprint.
The team decides from the Product backlog presented by the Product Owner.
The Product backlog items selected for the Sprint plus the delivery plan is called the Sprint backlog.
The work is divided into tasks of duration of one day or less.
The team can get external advice or renegotiate Product backlog items after realizing too much or too little work.
//Daily Scrum/Stand up Meeting
15min
A planning event, not a status tracking event.
Same place/time to reduce complexity.
During the meeting, each team member:
	What did he do yesterday that helped the team meet the Sprint Goal?
	What will he do today to help the team meet the Sprint Goal?
	Does he see any impediments to the Sprint goal?
Benefits of Daily Scrum Meeting:
	Improve communication within the team.
	Identify impediments, if any, in order to facilitate an early removal
	Highlight and promote quick decision-making.
	Improve the team's level of knowledge.
//Sprint Review
ScrumMaster responsible
2hrs 2weeks, 4hrs 1month sprints
End of every Sprint.
Presentation of the increment that is getting released is reviewed.
Scrum team and stakeholders collaborate to understand what was done.
Product Owner explains what Product backlog items have been completed and those that haven't.
Team discusses what went well and what problems arose and how they were solved.
Group discusses what should be done next which helps Sprint planning of the subsequent Sprint.
Scrum team then reviews the timeline,budget,potential capabilities,and marketplace for the next anticipated release
of the product increment.
//Sprint Retrospective
1hr 2week sprint, 3hr 1month sprint
After the Sprint Review
Introspect and improve within the Scrum process framework
1. Combine the learning from the last sprint, with regards to people,relationships,process,and tools.
2. Identify improvements.
3. Create a plan for implementing improvements to increase product quality.
/***********************************************************************
SCRUM ARTIFACTS
***********************************************************************/
Provide key info for the team and stakeholders
	understand the product
	activities
	plans
Artifacts:
	- product backlog
	- sprint backlog
	- burn-down chart
	- increment

//Product backlog (by Product Owner)
Evolving as it gets developed.
Ordered list of features needed as part of the end product.
Single source of requirements.
Lists: features, functions, requirements, enhancements, and fixes for future releases.
Item attributes: description, order, estimate, and value.
Higher-ordered items are clearer, detailed, more precise estimate. The lower the order, the lesser is the detail.
